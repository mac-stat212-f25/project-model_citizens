# Project description
Looking at the correlations between level, work and difficultly and the wellbeing of students, mentally and physically.

# Research question(s)
How do academic workload and perceived course difficulty relate to students' mental and physical wellbeing?
Do extracurriculars moderate or mediate this relationship?

# Reason/inspriation
Many students experience fluctuations in well being throughout the semester, often tied to workload, course difficulty, and academic level. This project was inspired by the observation that stress, burnout, and even physical health issues often intensify during demanding academic periods. Understanding these relationships can help school systems identify when and for whom academic pressures are most harmful.

# possible data set
```{r}
library(readr)

# rough impletation plan
1st task- preliminary data analysis
- both of us will do a version of this and come back together and compare our results
2nd task- clean data together
3rd task- formulate questions together
4th task- divide and conquer questions
- create some visualizations
5th task- come together, give each other feedback, and try to combine work into a cohesive data story
