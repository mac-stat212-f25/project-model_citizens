Analysis:
This case study analyzes The Pudding’s 2017 data-driven story about how major U.S. news outlets visually covered Trump and Clinton during the 2016 election. The purpose is to understand how the report structures a data story and use this approach to inform our own project.

The narrative unfolds in clear stages:
1. Research question introduced: How do media outlets visually portray the two candidates?
2. Data & scope stated: 12,147 Facebook images from 53 major U.S. outlets over two months.
3. Initial finding: Trump appears in more images than Clinton.
4. Engagement analysis: Trump-related posts receive more shares.
5. Outlet differences: Coverage patterns vary across news organizations and political lean.
6. Tone/emotion layer: Examines facial expressions and photo tone to discuss possible visual bias.
7. Methods section: Provides data collection and filtering details at the end for transparency.
The story moves from broad counts → engagement → media differences → emotional tone, building depth step-by-step.

Key Insights:
- Trump appeared more frequently and generated more engagement.
- Media outlets showed different patterns based on ideology.
- Tone and emotional expression in images may reflect subtle bias.
- The author avoids claiming causation, focusing on representation patterns.

Strengths: clear flow, strong visuals with clear color coding, transparent methods, avoids over-claiming, text has specific elements that help pull out main points.
Limitations: only Facebook data; short time window; facial-expression analysis is partly subjective.
