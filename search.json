Depression, anxiety and isolation are issues that are known to plague students. Could academic pressure be to blame? Or are there other variables at play that can lower or raise these conditions?\nThis data set from Kaggle focuses on Computer Science, Data Science, Software Engineering and Information technology majors. It spans all 4 academic years and contains a multitude of self reported measures, including depression, anxiety and isolation. Mental health and future insecurity are scaled 1-5 based on frequency, with 5 being the most frequent. In contrast all other variables scored 1-5 are graded based on difficultly with 5 being the most difficult. In addition to these self reported variables the dataset contains a multitude of information on the condition of students lives that could provide insight into what technology students feel and why they are feeling it.\nCode\nfont_add(family = \"RobotoCondensed\", \n         regular = \"data/raw/Roboto_Condensed/static/RobotoCondensed-Regular.ttf\",\n         bold = \"data/raw/Roboto_Condensed/static/RobotoCondensed-Bold.ttf\")\nshowtext_auto()\nCode\npercent_calc &lt;- function(column_name) {\n  MentalHealthSurvey |&gt;

Although the lower categories have slightly less, the upper three categories have similar percentages which demonstrates a variety of mental health experiences. In contrast we can see that a large percentage of the students found that academic workload and pressure was high. This could be due to their majors or the fact college is hard in general, but it is an interesting contrast to the mental health distribution. Future insecurity is the most evenly distributed across categories, further highlighting the vast variety of experiences and thoughts encompassed in this data set.",

The warmer colors represent stronger positive correlations, meaning that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. Cooler purple colors indicate negative correlations, meaning that as one increases, the other tends to decrease. One of the strongest relationships we found was between depression and anxiety, with a correlation of .84, suggesting these experiences often occur together. We also see that academic workload and academic pressure are moderately correlated with depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation, supporting our hypothesis that heavier academic stress is associated with poorer well-being, but maybe not as strongly as originally believed. On the opposite side, study satisfaction is negatively correlated with all mental-health outcomes. This suggests that students who feel more satisfied and supported in their studies tend to report fewer negative well-being symptoms. Overall, these patterns indicate a clear connection between academic stress and mental health in this student population, and they help us identify which variables may be most important for further analysis.",

Looking at GPA we can see from 2.0 up there is a rough trend in increasing depression. When looking at anxiety there is roughly the same trend except people with a 3.0-3.5 cgpa tend to have a slightly lower anxiety level. This could be that because they fall within this range the pressure to perform extremely well is lowered. Isolation follows that same trend. These trends are further emphasized in the box plot below.\n\n\nCode\ngpa &lt;- MentalHealthSurvey |&gt; \n  mutate(mean_mental_health = (isolation + depression + anxiety)/3) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = cgpa, y = mean_mental_health)) + \n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = cgpa), alpha = 0.5) + \n  theme_light() + \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) + \n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"0.0-0.0\" = \"#FD5901\", \"1.5-2.0\" = \"#F78104\", \"2.0-2.5\" = \"#FAAB36\", \"2.5-3.0\" = \"#249EA0\", \"3.0-3.5\" = \"#008083\", \"3.5-4.0\" = \"#005F60\")\n  ) + \n  labs(x = \"GPA\", y = \"Average Mental Health\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nstrip_colors &lt;- c(\"#249EA0\", \"#008083\",\"#005F60\")\n\ngpa_invest &lt;- MentalHealthSurvey |&gt; \n  filter(cgpa == \"3.5-4.0\" | cgpa == \"3.0-3.5\" | cgpa == \"2.5-3.0\") |&gt; \n  select(cgpa, isolation, depression, anxiety) |&gt; \n   pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(isolation, depression,  anxiety), \n    names_to = \"Type\", \n    values_to = \"Score\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Type, y = Score)) + \n  geom_violin(aes(fill = Type), alpha = 0.5) + \n  theme_light() + \n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"anxiety\" = \"#0d3b66\", \"depression\" = \"#faf0ca\", \"isolation\" = \"#f4d35e\")\n  ) + \n  facet_wrap2(~cgpa, strip = strip_themed(background_x = elem_list_rect(fill = c(\"#249EA080\", \"#00808380\",\"#005F6080\")))) + \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    strip.background = element_rect(fill = strip_colors),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n\n\n\nCode\ngpa / gpa_invest + plot_layout(heights = c(2, 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can clearly see that there is in fact large variability in the mental health of students who fall into the top 3 gpa categories. In fact that variability grows larger as GPA increases. In the top GPA category 3.5-4.0, we can see that students tend to rate anxiety and depression a 4-5. However, they are more variable in their reports of how frequently they experience isolation. Within the GPA category 3.0-3.5 we can see that students in that category tend to rate their anxiety more between a 2-3, which is reflected in the mean above. However their frequency of depression and isolation tends to have an almost even distribution across all categories. This demonstrates that students within this GPA category have extremely variable mental health experiences, which could be due to other factors of their life. Lastly looking at 2.5-3.0 range we can see that they in fact tend to score anxiety higher than those in the category above them. Their depression trends a slight more middle distribution than even, meaning mroe students fall within that middle area for depression. Similar to students in the category above them they most likely have a diverse expereience with mental health that could be less effected by academics which is impacting these results.",

However afterwords the relationship between number of activies and relationship to mental health categories begins to falter. This could be due to the fact that having more hobbies means that you stress yourself trying to make time for them all. It could also be that less students do 6 stress relieving activities, meaning that they are not meaningful representations of a large number of students. It is important to note that the the category with 0 activities consists of one person and is not reliable.\n\n\nCode\nMentalHealthSurvey |&gt; \n mutate(\n    NumberActivities = \n      case_when(\n      stress_relief_activities == \"Nothing\" ~ 0,\n      TRUE ~ str_count(stress_relief_activities, \",\") + 1 \n      )\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    depression = as.character(depression)\n  ) |&gt; \n  group_by(NumberActivities) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = depression, y = NumberActivities)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#faf0ca80\") + \n  labs(x = \"Depression\", y = \"Number of activities\", title = \"Number of Stress Relief activies influence on Depression\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nMentalHealthSurvey |&gt; \n mutate(\n    NumberActivities = \n      case_when(\n      stress_relief_activities == \"Nothing\" ~ 0,\n      TRUE ~ str_count(stress_relief_activities, \",\") + 1 \n      )\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    anxiety = as.character(anxiety)\n  ) |&gt; \n  group_by(NumberActivities) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = anxiety, y = NumberActivities)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#0d3b6680\") + \n  labs(x = \"Anxiety\", y = \"Number of activities\", title = \"Number of Stress Relief activies influence on Anxiety\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nMentalHealthSurvey |&gt; \n mutate(\n    NumberActivities = \n      case_when(\n      stress_relief_activities == \"Nothing\" ~ 0,\n      TRUE ~ str_count(stress_relief_activities, \",\") + 1 \n      )\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    isolation = as.character(isolation)\n  ) |&gt; \n  group_by(NumberActivities) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = isolation, y = NumberActivities)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#f4d35e80\") + \n  labs(x = \"Isolation\", y = \"Number of activities\", title = \"Number of Stress Relief activies influence on Isolation\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese boxplots demonstrate that students who experience mental health conditions at different frequencies tend to have the same number of stress relieving activities. Although the relative mean number of activies tends to show a possible trend for isolation and depression, the overlapping boxs indicate that it is not an extremely meaningful conclusion. There is to much overlap in the range for us to conclusivly say that the number of stress relieving activties a student does has a profound impact on their mental health. However, perhaps the type of activity that they do is more meaningful.",

Hobbies that fell into online entertainment, religious activities and social connections so the most variablity in mental health across the board. This suggest that these hobbies might not have as meaningful impacts upon students mental health as the other categoires. Sports fitness while a little variable, is more even than the remaining 3 variables. Those who use sports and fitness as a stress relieving activity seemingly tend to rate their mental health around a 3. Creative outlets is the variable with the smallest range which all students who have this hobby rating their mental health a 3 or above. These students seemingly tend to have high anxiety. It is unclear why this is a major trend. In comparison, students who practice outdoor activities tend lower in their average mental health. They especially seem to have low anxiety. Their depression and isolation frequency tends towards the middle. This is likely because being outside has long proven stress relieving properties. Lastly, sleep has an uneven distribution with their average mental health falling high towards 4. Similar to those with creative outlets they tend to have high anxiety, while thier depression and isolation has uneven distributions. It is unclear as to why students who mark sleep as a stress releving activity tend to be more anxious.\n\nSleep as a Stress Relief Activity\n\n\nCode\n# 1. Create a variable: did they list sleep as a stress-relief activity?\nMentalHealthSurvey &lt;- MentalHealthSurvey %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    sleep_relief = str_detect(str_to_lower(stress_relief_activities), \"sleep\"),\n    sleep_relief = if_else(sleep_relief, \"Sleep listed\", \"No sleep listed\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nMentalHealthSurvey &lt;- MentalHealthSurvey %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    average_sleep = factor(\n      average_sleep,\n      levels = c(\"2-4 hrs\", \"4-6 hrs\", \"7-8 hrs\"),\n      ordered = TRUE\n    )\n  )\n\nsleep_tab &lt;- MentalHealthSurvey %&gt;% \n  count(sleep_relief, average_sleep) %&gt;% \n  group_by(sleep_relief) %&gt;% \n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(MentalHealthSurvey, aes(x = sleep_relief, fill = average_sleep)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#EDAE4980\", \"#D1495B80\", \"#00798C80\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sleep duration among students who do vs. don't list sleep as stress relief\",\n    x = \"Sleep listed as stress-relief activity?\",\n    y = \"Proportion of students\",\n    fill = \"Average sleep\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing students who listed sleep as a stress-relief activity with those who did not, it is expected to see meaningful differences in their actual sleep duration. However, both groups showed nearly identical sleep patterns: most students reported only 4–6 hours of sleep per night, and the proportion achieving 7–8 hours was similarly small across groups. Notably, students who identified sleep as a coping strategy were not any more likely to obtain sufficient rest. This mismatch between students’ intended coping behaviors and their real constraints suggests that knowledge of healthy strategies alone is insufficient—structural pressures such as heavy workloads and scheduling demands may limit students’ ability to engage in effective self-care. This insight adds to the broader narrative that multiple, interacting factors shape mental-health outcomes in high-pressure academic environments.\n\n\nCode\n# re-read data\nMentalHealthSurvey &lt;- read_csv(\"data/raw/MentalHealthSurvey.csv\")\n\nMentalHealthSurvey &lt;- MentalHealthSurvey %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    sleep_cat = case_when(\n      average_sleep &gt;= 2 & average_sleep &lt; 4 ~ \"2–4 hours\",\n      average_sleep &gt;= 4 & average_sleep &lt; 6 ~ \"4–6 hours\",\n      average_sleep &gt;= 6 & average_sleep &lt;= 8 ~ \"6–8 hours\",\n      TRUE ~ NA_character_\n    ),\n    sleep_cat = factor(\n      sleep_cat,\n      levels = c(\"2–4 hours\", \"4–6 hours\", \"6–8 hours\")\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nMentalHealthSurvey %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(depression, anxiety, isolation, future_insecurity),\n    names_to = \"outcome\",\n    values_to = \"scores\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = sleep_cat, y = scores, fill = sleep_cat)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~ outcome, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#EDAE4980\", \"#D1495B80\", \"#00798C80\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mental-health outcomes by sleep category\",\n    x = \"Average sleep per night\",\n    y = \"Outcome score\",\n    fill = \"Sleep category\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross all four mental-health outcomes—anxiety, depression, isolation, and future insecurity—students who reported sleeping fewer than six hours per night showed consistently higher symptom levels. In contrast, those sleeping between six and eight hours reported noticeably lower distress, suggesting that even moderate increases in sleep duration may serve as a protective factor. These patterns were especially pronounced for anxiety and isolation, where median scores were substantially higher among short-sleepers. Together, these findings underscore the large diversity of factors shaping technology students’ mental health and highlight sleep as a meaningful contributor within this broader landscape.",

Do extracurriculars moderate or mediate this relationship?\n\n\nReason/inspriation\nMany students experience fluctuations in well being throughout the semester, often tied to workload, course difficulty, and academic level. This project was inspired by the observation that stress, burnout, and even physical health issues often intensify during demanding academic periods. Understanding these relationships can help school systems identify when and for whom academic pressures are most harmful.\n\n\npossible data set\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nMentalHealthSurvey &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/raw/MentalHealthSurvey.csv\")\nView(MentalHealthSurvey)\n\n\n\n\nrough impletation plan\n1st task- preliminary data analysis - both of us will do a version of this and come back together and compare our results 2nd task- clean data together 3rd task- formulate questions together 4th task- divide and conquer questions - create some visualizations 5th task- come together, give each other feedback, and try to combine work into a cohesive data story",
