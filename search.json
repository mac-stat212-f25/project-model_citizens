Do extracurriculars moderate or mediate this relationship?\n\n\nReason/inspriation\nMany students experience fluctuations in well being throughout the semester, often tied to workload, course difficulty, and academic level. This project was inspired by the observation that stress, burnout, and even physical health issues often intensify during demanding academic periods. Understanding these relationships can help school systems identify when and for whom academic pressures are most harmful.\n\n\npossible data set\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nMentalHealthSurvey &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/raw/MentalHealthSurvey.csv\")\nView(MentalHealthSurvey)\n\n\n\n\nrough impletation plan\n1st task- preliminary data analysis - both of us will do a version of this and come back together and compare our results 2nd task- clean data together 3rd task- formulate questions together 4th task- divide and conquer questions - create some visualizations 5th task- come together, give each other feedback, and try to combine work into a cohesive data story",
