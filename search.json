Do extracurriculars moderate or mediate this relationship?\n\n\nReason/inspriation\nMany students experience fluctuations in well being throughout the semester, often tied to workload, course difficulty, and academic level. This project was inspired by the observation that stress, burnout, and even physical health issues often intensify during demanding academic periods. Understanding these relationships can help school systems identify when and for whom academic pressures are most harmful.\n\n\npossible data set\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nMentalHealthSurvey &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/raw/MentalHealthSurvey.csv\")\nView(MentalHealthSurvey)\n\n\n\n\nrough impletation plan\n1st task- preliminary data analysis - both of us will do a version of this and come back together and compare our results 2nd task- clean data together 3rd task- formulate questions together 4th task- divide and conquer questions - create some visualizations 5th task- come together, give each other feedback, and try to combine work into a cohesive data story",

    "text": "Source: Samora, Russell. “How News Media Covers Trump & Clinton.” The Pudding, 2017. https://pudding.cool/2017/03/elections/\nAnalysis: This case study analyzes The Pudding’s 2017 data-driven story about how major U.S. news outlets visually covered Trump and Clinton during the 2016 election. The purpose is to understand how the report structures a data story and use this approach to inform our own project.\nThe narrative unfolds in clear stages: 1. Research question introduced: How do media outlets visually portray the two candidates? 2. Data & scope stated: 12,147 Facebook images from 53 major U.S. outlets over two months. 3. Initial finding: Trump appears in more images than Clinton. 4. Engagement analysis: Trump-related posts receive more shares. 5. Outlet differences: Coverage patterns vary across news organizations and political lean. 6. Tone/emotion layer: Examines facial expressions and photo tone to discuss possible visual bias. 7. Methods section: Provides data collection and filtering details at the end for transparency. The story moves from broad counts → engagement → media differences → emotional tone, building depth step-by-step.\nKey Insights: - Trump appeared more frequently and generated more engagement. - Media outlets showed different patterns based on ideology. - Tone and emotional expression in images may reflect subtle bias. - The author avoids claiming causation, focusing on representation patterns.\nStrengths: clear flow, strong visuals with clear color coding, transparent methods, avoids over-claiming, text has specific elements that help pull out main points. Limitations: only Facebook data; short time window; facial-expression analysis is partly subjective.",
